# An outliner, a GraphQL learning experiment

Wherein the author gets back up to speed on building applications around GraphQL APIs.

## Prologue

It's been a while since I read up on GraphQL. I originally (2015?) thought it was a pretty good idea when I worked on a team with hundreds of developers and dozens of APIs. I've since worked on teams with dozens of developers and one (large) API. So my need for the  technology faded. Which is fine, because it gave time for a community to form, early adopters to do their thing, and for everything to improve.

So, where does it stand, several years later, in early 2019? Time for me to roll up my sleeves, deal with JavaScript, and see what I can see!

## The GraphQL schema

(where the magic happens)

## The database model

(every service starts out managing its own data model; eventually they get further and further from talking to a thing that actually writes to disk)

## The service

(you put the database in the HTTP and then you mix it all up)

## An end-to-end test

(we prove this isn't smoke and mirrors)

## Epilogue
